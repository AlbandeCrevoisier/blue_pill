Goofing around with a Blue Pill (STM32F103C8T6).

Since this is a bare metal project, I don't want to include any lib. There is,
however, the issue of register acces, often done with the elegant:
(* (volatile uint32_t *) 0xXXXXXXXX)
which requires stdint. It would appear that uint32_t is always defined as an
unsigned int, on this architecture at least. It may not be standard compliant,
but I'd rather use a typedef unsigned int uint32_t than include stdint.
